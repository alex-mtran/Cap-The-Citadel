# Cap-The-Citadel

## Project Description

This project is a deck building card game developed using the Godot engine with scripts created in the engine's native GDScript programming language. The player goes through a randomly generated map battling against enemies with different attack and block powers by choosing and applying cards with different actions. There are options to adjust settings, save and load files for the game state so that players can continue from a previous session, and cumulative rewards that improve the player's abilities as the game goes on.

### Instructions for building and running game

Before the project can be opened for viewing in the game development environment, the Godot app should be installed on the current device. The project can be then viewed in the editor for the Godot game engine by cloning the repository and importing the cloned folder in the Godot app. After the editor launches this project, all of the scenes, scripts, assets, and more can be viewed as it appears in the game.

To run the game, it can be either ran within the Godot editor by clicking on the play button at the upper-right corner or after the executable for the game is built through the editor as follows:

* Click on the *Project* section at the upper-left corner and then select the *Export...* option in the drop-down menu for this section.
* In the export window next to *Presets*, click on *Add...* and then select a format in which to export the game project.
* At the bottom of this window, click on *Export Project...*, choose a directory in which to store this exported runnable file, and select *Save* to confirm the export.
* Navigate to the directory location of the exported game executable and open it to play the game.
